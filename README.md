## Creating a project

## Cookie, Authentication, MongoDB and Sveltekit

This example came [from this stackoverflow posting,](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69066169/how-to-implement-cookie-authentication-sveltekit-mongodb/) user Nikolas Blahu≈°iak

It was inspired by this youtube video

## Mods

A few modifications have been made to the code.  A few console.log() entries. 
Some mods made to /profile/index.svelte to make things look better.  

You can get a glimpse on how to integrate to a MongoDB, and how to use hooks.  
I was surprised how many times those console.logs hit the server.  

I'm also very surprised as to how many db connections there are in place 
from a single application running on my local host. 

## Run this sample

Note: you will need to create an account at mongodb.com, sign up for a free 
test tier server, and enter your credentials in the file: /config/default.json
